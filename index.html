      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="images/about-me.jpg" alt="About Me Image">
      As a dedicated student developer with a deep-rooted passion for gaming, I have found a special connection with Riot Games. My journey with their flagship games, League of Legends, spans over a decade. With my time with Team Fight Tactics starting right from release. This long-standing engagement has evolved into a dream to contribute to a company that's been a significant part of my life.

My commitment extends beyond gaming. I resonate strongly with Riot Games' mission of diversity and inclusion. This is evidenced by my volunteer work with the Chicago Asian Women Empowerment, a 501(c) nonprofit, where I've had the opportunity to make a meaningful difference in the community.

Academically, I have pursued a robust set of Computer Science courses, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge. This doesn't just end in the classroom; I am also an avid learner in solving questions on leetcode.com and continually seek out new knowledge online. This self-driven learning ethos underscores my approach to both personal and professional development.

I pride myself on my strong communication skills, which I believe are crucial in a collaborative and innovative environment like Riot Games. Whether it's discussing complex technical problems or brainstorming creative ideas, I thrive in settings that require clear and effective dialogue.

In summary, my journey with Riot Games has been more than just a gaming experience; it's been a source of inspiration, learning, and growth. I am excited about the possibility of bringing my unique blend of passion, skills, and experience to a company that has shaped so much of my life.
